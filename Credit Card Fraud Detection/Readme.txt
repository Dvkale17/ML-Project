Credit Card Fraud Prediction


I have downloaded dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud this url. The dataset contains 
transaction made by credit card in september 2013 by european cardholders. This dataset present transaction 
that occured in two days, we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transaction. The dataset is highly unbalanced, 
the positive class(fraud) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

basically the output column is class which is binary data so that this is unsupervised machine learning problem
and data is unbalanced thats why i have used Random Forest Classifiers which gave me 0.99% accuracy of my model.
